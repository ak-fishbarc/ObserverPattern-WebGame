# ObserverPattern-WebGame
A project to practice Observer Pattern, Flask, HTML, JavaScript, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis and ideally Docker.
What I'm trying to build here is a small version of a browser game similar to Grepolis, Travian, etc.

# 21.04.2024:
**What am I trying to achieve(Intent):**
- Create a system that will allow user to build units or upgrade buildings without the user feeling or seeing that the page was reloaded in the background.
- Update user's resources data in MongoDB collection when building units or upgrading buildings, according to cost.
- Code will need some clean up/refactoring once done with the other tasks.
 
**Currently:**
- Learning JavaScript and HTML
- Trying out: Threading, Multiprocessing and Asyncio to get the task running in the background without preventing the user from using the game.
